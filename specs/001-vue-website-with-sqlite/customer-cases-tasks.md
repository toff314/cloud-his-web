# Tasks: Customer Cases Page

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-vue-website-with-sqlite/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file path in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 [P] Initialize backend package.json with express, sqlite3, cors, helmet, morgan dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Initialize frontend package.json with vue@next, vue-router@4, pinia dependencies
- [ ] T004 [P] Install development dependencies for backend (nodemon, jest, supertest)
- [ ] T005 [P] Install development dependencies for frontend (@vitejs/plugin-vue, vite)
- [ ] T006 Create initial directory structures for backend and frontend

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T007 Create database configuration file at backend/src/config/database.config.js
- [ ] T008 [P] Create database initialization service at backend/src/services/sqlite-initializer.service.js
- [ ] T009 Create main application entry point at backend/src/app.js
- [ ] T010 Create Vite configuration for frontend at frontend/vite.config.js
- [ ] T011 [P] Create basic routing configuration at frontend/src/router/index.js
- [ ] T012 [P] Create Pinia store configuration at frontend/src/store/index.js
- [ ] T013 Create API service to connect frontend to backend at frontend/src/services/api.service.js
- [ ] T014 Create content fetcher service at frontend/src/services/content-fetcher.service.js
- [ ] T015 Create basic App.vue component at frontend/src/App.vue

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Phase 5: User Story 2 - Manage Website Metadata (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable content managers to manage website metadata locally without external dependencies.

**Independent Test**: Content managers should be able to update website metadata stored in the local SQLite database.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 3 - View Images Locally (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Allow users to view images on the website without uploads happening externally to maintain privacy.

**Independent Test**: Images should be served locally without any external upload functionality.

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T082 [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] T083 Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] T084 Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] T085 [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/
- [ ] T086 Security hardening
- [ ] T087 Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 1 Extension**: Depends on User Story 1 completion
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Contract test for GET /content endpoint in backend/tests/contract/test-content-api.js"
Task: "Contract test for GET /content/:slug endpoint in backend/tests/contract/test-content-slug-api.js"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create WebsiteContent model in backend/src/models/content.model.js"
Task: "Create PageMetadata model in backend/src/models/page-metadata.model.js"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 1 Extension → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
